Linear Search algorithms implemented for the first lesson of the Artificial Intelligence class.

This project better illustrates my C# skills than the ellipse finder, of which I'm still proud. In this project I no longer cram every function in one file, I use classes,
I use lambda expressions for evaluating math functions etc.

I really liked that class.

Warning, there are comments in Polish.
